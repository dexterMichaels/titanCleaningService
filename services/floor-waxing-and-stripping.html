          <div class="process-step">
            <h3>4. Multi-Coat Wax Application</h3>

          <div class="process-step">
            <h3>5. Final Buffing</h3>

                <p>Most commercial VCT and vinyl floors benefit from a full strip and wax every 6 to 12 months, depending on foot traffic. High-traffic areas like retail stores and schools may need more frequent maintenance. We can recommend a schedule tailored to your facility.</p>

                <p>A full strip and wax typically takes 4 to 8 hours depending on the size of the area, the number of wax coats applied, and the condition of the existing finish. We apply multiple coats with drying time between each layer for a durable, glossy result.</p>
