If you're like most homeowners, you probably vacuum your carpets regularly but wonder how often you should invest in a professional deep cleaning. The answer depends on several factors, from how many people live in your home to whether you have pets or allergy sufferers.

## The General Rule

The Carpet and Rug Institute recommends professional carpet cleaning **every 12 to 18 months** for an average household. However, this is just a starting point. Your specific situation may call for more frequent cleanings.

## Factors That Affect Cleaning Frequency

### Household Size

More people means more foot traffic, more spills, and more dirt being tracked indoors. If you live in a busy household with three or more people, consider professional cleaning **every 6 to 12 months**.

### Pets

Dogs and cats bring in outdoor dirt, shed fur, and can have accidents. Pet dander also builds up deep within carpet fibres where vacuuming can't reach. Pet owners should schedule professional cleanings **every 3 to 6 months**.

### Allergies and Asthma

Carpets trap allergens like dust mites, pollen, and mould spores. If anyone in your household suffers from allergies or asthma, more frequent professional cleanings, around **every 3 to 4 months**, can make a real difference in air quality and symptom relief.

### Children

Little ones spend a lot of time playing on the floor, making clean carpets even more important for their health. Households with young children should aim for professional cleaning **every 6 to 9 months**.

### Light-Coloured Carpets

Light carpets show stains and discolouration more readily. If you have white or cream carpets, you'll likely want professional cleaning **every 6 months** to keep them looking their best.

## Signs Your Carpet Needs Cleaning Now

Don't wait for the calendar to tell you it's time. Watch for these signs:

- **Visible stains or spots** that vacuuming won't remove
- **Dull or matted appearance** in high-traffic areas
- **Lingering odours** even after vacuuming
- **Increased allergy symptoms** at home
- **It's been more than a year** since your last professional clean

## Why Professional Cleaning Matters

While regular vacuuming is important, it only removes surface-level dirt. Professional hot water extraction (steam cleaning) reaches deep into carpet fibres to remove:

- Ground-in soil and grime
- Bacteria and allergens
- Pet dander and odours
- Stubborn stains
- Dust mites and their waste

At Titan Cleaning Service, we use commercial-grade equipment and eco-friendly cleaning solutions to get your carpets truly clean without leaving harsh chemical residues behind.

## Tips Between Professional Cleanings

To keep your carpets in great shape between professional cleanings:

1. **Vacuum at least twice a week**, more in high-traffic areas
2. **Remove shoes at the door** to reduce tracked-in dirt
3. **Blot spills immediately** with a clean cloth (never rub!)
4. **Use doormats** at every entrance
5. **Rearrange furniture occasionally** to change traffic patterns
