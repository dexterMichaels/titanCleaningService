If you've been putting off getting your carpets cleaned, the first question on your mind is probably: *what's this going to cost me?* Fair enough. Nobody wants to call around for quotes without at least a ballpark number in mind.

Here's a straightforward look at **carpet cleaning cost in Victoria BC** — what you can expect to pay, what drives the price up or down, and whether it's worth hiring a professional or renting a machine yourself.

## Average Carpet Cleaning Prices in Victoria

Across the Greater Victoria area, most professional carpet cleaning companies charge in one of two ways: **per room** or **per square foot**.

**Per room pricing** typically falls between **$100 and $200 per room**, depending on the size of the room and the company you hire. Most companies define a "room" as an area up to about 200 square feet — roughly the size of a standard bedroom. Larger living rooms or open-concept spaces may count as two rooms.

**Per square foot pricing** usually ranges from **$0.25 to $0.60 per square foot**. This method tends to be more precise, and it's what many homeowners prefer because you're paying for exactly the area being cleaned.

So for a typical three-bedroom home in Fernwood or James Bay, you might be looking at somewhere between $300 and $600 for the main carpeted areas. That's a wide range, but keep reading — there are good reasons for the spread.

## What Affects the Price?

Not every carpet cleaning job is the same. Here are the biggest factors that move the needle on your final quote.

### Room Size and Layout

This one's obvious, but worth mentioning. A small den takes less time and solution than a sprawling basement rec room. Open floor plans with large continuous carpeted areas may actually save you money compared to several smaller rooms with tight corners and doorways.

### Stain Severity

Light traffic soiling from everyday use is one thing. Ground-in stains from red wine, coffee, mud tracked in from a rainy walk along Dallas Road, or years of accumulated grime? That's another story. Heavy staining often requires pre-treatment, extra passes, or specialty spotting solutions — all of which add to the cost.

### Pet Odour and Stain Treatment

If you have dogs, cats, or other furry family members, pet odour treatment is one of the most common add-ons. Pet urine can soak deep into carpet fibres and even the underpad beneath. A surface clean won't cut it — proper enzyme treatments are needed to break down the odour at its source. Expect to pay extra for this service, but it's absolutely worth it if you want results that last.

### Furniture Moving

Some companies include basic furniture moving (shifting a couch or coffee table) in their price. Others charge extra. If you can move smaller pieces out of the way before the crew arrives, you'll often save yourself some money and speed up the job.

### Stairs and Hallways

Stairs are time-consuming to clean properly — each step needs individual attention. Most companies charge per step or per flight. Hallways, while not technically "rooms," are usually priced separately as well.

### Type of Cleaning Method

Hot water extraction (often called steam cleaning) is the gold standard and what most professionals use. It provides the deepest clean and is recommended by major carpet manufacturers. Some companies offer dry cleaning or bonnet cleaning at lower prices, but these methods don't remove as much embedded dirt and are better suited for maintenance cleans between deep cleans.

## DIY Rental vs Professional Cleaning: Is It Worth Saving the Money?

You can rent a carpet cleaning machine from most hardware stores in Victoria for about **$40 to $80 per day**, plus the cost of cleaning solution. On paper, that looks like a bargain compared to professional carpet cleaning cost in Victoria BC.

But here's what you're actually getting with a rental unit:

- **Less suction power.** Rental machines simply can't extract water and dirt the way professional truck-mounted equipment can. This often leaves carpets damp for 24 hours or more, which can lead to mould and mildew — a real concern in our West Coast climate where humidity is already high.
- **No pre-treatment.** Professionals apply targeted pre-spray solutions that break down oils, dirt, and stains before the main cleaning even begins. With a rental, you're essentially just running soapy water over the surface.
- **Risk of over-wetting.** Without training, it's easy to saturate the carpet and pad. Over-wet carpets can develop odours, buckle, or even delaminate from the backing.
- **Your time.** Between picking up the machine, moving furniture, cleaning, waiting for carpets to dry, and returning the rental, you're looking at a full day's work for mediocre results.

For a quick refresh between professional cleanings, a rental can be fine. But for a proper deep clean — especially if you're dealing with stains, odours, or haven't had the carpets cleaned in a year or more — professional service pays for itself in results and longevity.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Carpets?

Most carpet manufacturers recommend professional cleaning every **12 to 18 months** to maintain your warranty and keep fibres in good shape. If you have kids, pets, or allergies, every **6 to 12 months** is a better target.

Here on Vancouver Island, our damp winters mean more moisture tracked indoors, and that moisture carries dirt deep into carpet fibres. Regular professional cleaning helps prevent that buildup from becoming permanent damage — protecting your investment and keeping your indoor air quality healthy.
