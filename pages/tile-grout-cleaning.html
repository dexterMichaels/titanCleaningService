        <div class="process-steps stagger-children">
          <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Assessment &amp; Pre-Treatment</h3>
            <p>We inspect your tile and grout to identify the tile type, grout condition, and any problem areas. A professional-grade alkaline or pH-neutral pre-treatment solution is applied to break down embedded dirt, grease, and buildup in the grout lines.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="process-step">
            <h3>High-Pressure Steam Extraction</h3>
            <p>Using our truck-mounted or portable high-pressure steam system, we blast hot water into the grout lines and tile surface at controlled pressure. This loosens and extracts deep-seated dirt, mold, and bacteria that regular mopping cannot reach.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Grout Line Detailing</h3>
            <p>After the main extraction, we go over each grout line with specialized brushes and tools to ensure every inch is thoroughly cleaned. Stubborn stains and discoloration receive targeted treatment for maximum restoration.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Rinse &amp; Dry</h3>
            <p>We rinse the entire surface with clean water to remove any remaining cleaning solution and residue. Excess moisture is extracted, and the floor is left clean and ready to walk on within 1 to 2 hours.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Optional Sealer Application</h3>
            <p>For long-lasting protection, we offer a professional grout sealer application. The sealer penetrates into the grout to create a barrier against future staining, moisture absorption, and mold growth &mdash; extending the life of your clean.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                For most homes, we recommend professional tile and grout cleaning every 12 to 18 months. High-traffic areas like kitchen floors and bathroom showers may benefit from more frequent cleaning every 6 to 12 months. Regular maintenance between professional cleanings helps keep grout looking its best.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                Yes, we clean natural stone tiles including marble, travertine, slate, and granite. Natural stone requires pH-neutral cleaning solutions to avoid etching or discoloration. We assess your stone type before cleaning and use the appropriate products and techniques for safe, effective results.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                Shower tile and grout is one of our most requested services. Showers are especially prone to mold, mildew, soap scum, and hard water buildup. Our high-pressure steam extraction and grout detailing process restores shower walls and floors to their original appearance.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                No. Our cleaning process is safe for all types of grout including sanded, unsanded, and epoxy grout. We use controlled pressure and professional-grade solutions designed specifically for grout cleaning. If your grout is already cracked or deteriorating, we will let you know before we begin.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                Tile floors typically dry within 1 to 2 hours after cleaning. If grout sealer is applied, we recommend staying off the sealed areas for 24 hours to allow the sealer to fully cure. We will provide specific care instructions based on your situation.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                Yes, we offer grout sealing as an add-on service. Sealing grout after a professional cleaning helps protect it from future staining, moisture absorption, and mold growth. We recommend sealing for all residential grout, especially in kitchens, bathrooms, and entryways.
